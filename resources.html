							<p>What follows here is a curated list of recommendations and resources that aims to collate the copious amount of information 
                that's already out there about the climate crisis and what we can do about it--with an added editorial spirit. 
                Note that there are not books included here;

              <h3>In the household</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Shorten "reduce, reuse, recycle" to: reduce and reuse. Consumerism is at the heart of many, if not all, climate issues.
                In the market for buying something? Engage in mindfullness and ask yourself, is the thing I'm going to buy, going to last? Will it serve more than one purpose? 
                  Can I take care of it in such a way, that I can ensure its life cycle will be long and fruitful? What factors are going in to my desire to buy this item--genuine need, or excessive advertising of a current trend?
		</li>
		<li>For clothing specifically, as someone above a UK size 12, whilst I do try to engage in secondhand shopping and will often use Depop, accounts like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andreacheong_/?hl=en">Andrea Cheong's</a>
			and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grassntitties/?hl=en">Cora's</a> have showcased the pitfalls of fast-fashion and provide educational material on how to tell for yourself 
			whether that item is made shoddily and unfairly (to both the environment and the workers involved). The more I learn about such practices, the more I have been able to disentangle 
			my desire for new items from actually purchasing them, and the more excited I am to make personal sacrifices--wait, and buy better, later.
                </li>               
                <li>Make greener substitutions where you can. This is particularly easy in the UK for the bathroom and kitchen, with many subsitute products available to reduce 
                  the amount of plastic (and thus carbon) you're bringing in to your home. <a href="https://greenecofriend.co.uk/sustainable-eco-friendly-alternatives/">greenecofriend</a> 
                  is one of many sites where you can find information about how to swap things out for items that you hopefully will never have to buy new again.
                  Before dismissing an item as unsuitable for your lifestyle, sit down and examine if you're saying "no" too soon and too fast. We should never dole out guilt for personal choices, given the late-stage capitalism we endure,
                  but we also should be honest, open-minded, and trying our hardest, as ultimately, every pound/dollar/euro spent represents a vote made. Small inconveniences can matter little, in the grand scheme of things, compared to those we are already experiencing due to climate breakdown.
			Additionally, often what initially is a small inconvenience, can be easily folded into new routines given a little more thought. Sometimes these new routines will be slower-paced than what we are used to--e.g. baking your own bread on a Sunday night 
			in place of buying plastic-wrapped loaves takes time and commitment. But these changes can also increase our quality of life substantially, and allow us to savor the small details--who doesn't love the smell of baking bread to gently whisk you into the working week? 
		</li>	
                <li>Bring the topic up. Open up a conversation with those around you, from your hairdresser to your children. When you hear misinformation, tackle it. When you hear someone dismissing the matter,
                  "oh just a bit hot today, isn't it", gently relate it to the climate crisis and dispel the notion that it's just "an odd hot day now and again." Make sure to engage in active deep listening when speaking to others on the topic.
                  Ask them gentle, leading questions if they are convinced of a piece of misinformation.</li> 
		<li>Actively take care of yourself. There is no use in burning out; it will do you no good, nor will it help with climate change. If you're feeling overreached, sit down and evaluate your priorities.
			Ensure you are engaging with activities regularly that make you feel like yourself, that connect you to your community, that bring you joy and challenge in equal measure.
			Seek out mentors; utilise therapy, exercise, and nature; and find the best ways for you to work and play. 
		</li>
		      <li>If you are in a position to do so, advocate for institutional level change . Join protests, write letters to your government representatives, join local councils.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>At work</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Advocate for changes to the workplace that could make it more eco-friendly. For example--are there appropriate waste recycling points? Could you e.g. create a collection point for soft plastics, 
                  to be taken monthly to a store or centre that will actually recycle it?</li>
                <li>You know your job better than anyone else. What could you do to decarbonise any processes you undergo at your job? Or create less waste? Every job needs to be a "green" job for our future economy.</li> 
              </ul>
              <h2>I want to do more...</h3>
              <p> If this is not enough to quench your desire to <i>do</i> something, if you are plagued by the notion that you could be doing more,
                but are unsure of how to transition to a "green" job, peruse the below to see if there's a fit out there for you. Remember that, like all career advice should come back to,
                where you will be best placed is where you can find the intersection of: what brings you joy, what you're good at, and what work (that you can identify from your perspective) needs doing.
                If you require any additional resources for help with developing hiring materials (C.V., cover letters, etc.) or leadership/project management skills in order to level-up, 
                or enact the changes in the Actions column above, please email in.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make sure that you narrow down which area of climate you want to work on. Is it on the policy side? Data science? Research? Start researching what jobs in these sectors are like, 
                and try to 'test out' what the work itself will entail. Try to: reach out to folks you know in these areas (or don't know: politely request information through social media, if they talk about their job online); 
                gain qualifications through sites like EdX in relevant areas of the work; and keep your ear to the ground in the sector by following relevant news.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://workonclimate.org/">Work on Climate:</a> Slack community founded by tech workers who wanted to help people leaving their current jobs and find climate-based ones.</li>
									<li><a href="https://climatebase.org/">Climatebase:</a> database of climate jobs around the world.</li>
									<li>Leverage social medias. There are many climate academics and organisations on Twitter, and often threads are featured that showcase different climate job openings.
            Additionally, LinkedIn can provide a valuable way to find openings: use your existing network to see if there are any companies working on "green" issues in your network and reach out from there. 
            You can also try establishing new networks by reaching out to alumni at your alma maters that are in green jobs or companies.</li>
