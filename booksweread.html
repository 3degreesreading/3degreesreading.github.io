							<h1>Books we read</h1>
							<p>Please note that I do not have a Goodreads account. There are multiple layers to my decision for this: the fact that Amazon owns Goodreads is one, and I morally try to avoid using anything from Amazon services if I can help it. The more personal layer is because I don’t want to game-ify my reading. I read for myself, as a hobby, and feel strongly that we don’t always need to quantify our hobbies so much. Analytics are often sold to the highest bidder to pay for the technology behind it and further manipulate us through algorithms; meanwhile, we are too often left only with the feeling that something that was once purely for pleasure, is now part of a competition, against ourselves and our friends. Additionally, part of the joy of reading is that it’s something entirely analog (even my Kindle, which features an ink-screen, and is not connected to the Wi-Fi, feels analog); and adding constantly what I have read, categorising and dissecting it through numbers (how many stars would I give this? With no further context or explanation thereof?) turns it in to yet another digital chore. It’s another highlight reel where, I feel, the cons have not yet outweighed the pros. </p> <br />
<p>I have considered supporting Storygraph, an independent small business, if only for the recommendations and the excellent categorisations, which I am curious to try out. If you are on Storygraph and would like to see 3Degrees on there, please reach out and let me know.</p> <br />
<p>Below I have categorised the books we have reviewed thus far, divided by genre. If the book fits multiple genres, then it will feature in the top two genres to which I feel it belongs to (more details thereof undoubtedly explored in the review!). </p> <br />
