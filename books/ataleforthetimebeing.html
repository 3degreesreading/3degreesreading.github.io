							<h1>A Tale for the Time Being</h1>
							<h2>by Violet Ruth Ozeki</h2>
							<p>Time, to me, is an island coastline. The horizon dips and rises, the waves reeling in events sometimes one after another, crashing on to shore, until months feel like weeks and hours turn into minutes. Other times the tide pulls me so quietly and gently forward that momentary joys ebb and linger like the sand over your feet that doesn't want to re-join the ocean.</p><br />

<p>Perhaps no more evidence of this is needed than me proclaiming <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i>  would be the September book of the month, and thinking I was ahead of the curve for having read it early--only to then realise that, what felt like moments later, we were already in mid-October and I had not shared my review as promised. </p><br />

<p>Ozeki captures these feelings so beautifully. Ruth's lunge-lurch through discovering Nao's story, brought to her as ocean flotsam, plays like these waves of time, and it's hard not to echo the character Muriel's feelings: when you're enveloped in Nao's story the pages turn themselves as you're chasing down resolution for Nao. Ozeki's elegant prose does not bely the ability to convey the thoughts of a teenager--many a novel has turned to reductive prose in order to portray younger characters, much to their own detriment. You need the distinctive, thoughtful, well-written voice Ozeki gives Nao in order to stomach her story--there are very few books where I have been so distraught by what happens to a character that I have needed a break from the story, but more than once I have had to put down <i>Time Being</i> to digest the events, tears in my eyes. </p><br />

<p>Ruth's perspective is equally fascinating. Of course, there is the very meta nature of Ruth being the academic with writer's block; but more than that, Ruth's deeply introspective nature shines gently through to the reader, ushering the reader into physical and spiritual concepts with ease, so you never feel like you've been lectured. Ruth's trust in her partner gives you a cautious optimism that you need when the trust turns to, at times, misgivings.</p><br />

<p>There's so much to delve in to with this novel. There are so many themes that are worth exploring: of course, that of time (that beautiful title); but also what memory is, and how it shapes us. Examining what home is: how we lose it, how we can find it again, exploring what Iit means to be an immigrant. What happens to us as we lose the connections that we hold dear. Nature, as a witness to what we humans do, and how it marks that for us--but equally, how we engrain ourselves into nature effortlessly. What it means, what it truly means, to be sending our children in to war, and how carelessly we shake about the concept of peace when we are <i>at</i> peace. </p><br />

 <blockquote>Life is fleeting. Don't waste a single moment of your precious life. Wake up now! And now! And now!</blockquote>
<p>--Ruth Ozeki, <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i></p><br />

<p>I'm not sure I'm ready to give written words to my thoughts about these themes as they pertain to Ozeki; to my understanding of my own notions of home and spirituality, to the human condition; to climate change. I look forward to rereading this beautifully dense, enthralling, deeply compassionate novel--they will come then. Until then I can sense them, on that horizon, dipping sometimes into the sunset, bobbing along until I have the time to examine them deeper, armed with pen and paper. </p><br />
