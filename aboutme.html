							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Framing and context:</h4>
							<p>these are the things that ground us, when we read, when we analyse the news and stories around us. My context: I am a white woman, in her mid-20’s, from Germany, from the US, from China, from the U.K. 
                This book club comes out of wanting to share words: my words, other writer’s words, and to see how others receive them. Words are our common past; carbon, our common future. 
                Too much carbon, too much methane, too much nitrogen--none of us can click our fingers and vanquish the elements. <br />
                </p>
		<h4>We can only do what is within our passion, and our daily remit.</h4>
		<p>I read everyday; I have since, at three, I first battled through the magic of going from alphabet to words: 
                this is my daily passion. I want to investigate books here that are climate fiction, that examine issues of environmental justice, imagine how the world will be if we don’t instigate action, 
                explore how we think we will react to each other when questions of survival push us to the edge. I am not just here for desperation, or for trauma porn, or for the nitty-gritty all of the time. 
		</p>
						<h4>I am also here to hope:</h4>
		<p>and that means, equally, exploring what it would be like to live in a world where we fix this, but must live in communities where we live sustainably, equitably, and aware of each other. 
                That’s a tall order for climate fiction, for science fiction, so this book club isn’t just for those genres, it’s for contemporary fiction, for fiction, for biographies, for occasionally non-fiction. 
                I come from a STEM PhD background, so it’s also an outlet for scicomms (ever wondered how to read the IPCC report that keeps getting headlined?). <br />
							</p>
	
		<h4>This isn't just about me;</h4>
		<p>
							nor am I the only one who has read books that they think share lessons pivotal for us all to learn: please, join in! Tell me: what have you read recently, 
                that sparks your joy and communicates something you think our society, quickly coming up on 1.5 degrees, needs to know? What books have lit your passion recently? 
                What do you think about the books already read--do you agree with that analysis? Email, DM on Instagram, let's start a dialogue.
              </p>
